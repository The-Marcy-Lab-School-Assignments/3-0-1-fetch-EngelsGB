# Question

What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer

The first argument passed into `fetch` is the url of the resource we want to request and the second argument passed is the type of request we want to make, this second argument is an object with a few specific properties. `fetch` returns a promise that contains the response from the server.

3/3
# Teacher Feedback
Just so you know second argument is called `options`. You were spot on otherwise!
